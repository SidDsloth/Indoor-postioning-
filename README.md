# Indoor-positioning
Project part of IEEE NITK-ENVISION 2019.The following project helps to determine the coordinates of an object with reference to 3 anchor points.
We are using arduinos for RF transmition and receival and ultrasound for signal transmition for distance measurment between object and anchor points.
Then the concept of Trilateration is used in order to determine the precise object coordinates.
